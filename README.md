About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Ethan Dobbin â€” a recent Computer Science graduate from Towson University with a strong interest in software engineering, data science/AI, and cybersecurity.

I enjoy building end-to-end solutions: from writing clean code and designing data pipelines, to experimenting with neural networks and deploying applications to the cloud. Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from crime prediction models and AI-powered resume screening tools to web utilities built with React and Flask.

Beyond tech, Iâ€™m also the founder of ShotByDob / SBD Media, a photography and videography business. Running my own LLC has sharpened my skills in entrepreneurship, client communication, and creative problem-solving.
